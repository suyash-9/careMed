## About
   careMed is a Healthcare web application that bridges the gap between appointments. Users and their doctors can track their mental health by answering a daily questionnaire and a video submission. We made an intuitive web application that allows users to fill out a form about their well-being on that particular day. Users can also add a video Journal with themselves with each form entry. Seamlessly allows users to see their previous entries and look at their progress over time.

## Inspiration
